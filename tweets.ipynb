    "# Initial thoughts \n",
    "### Things done well:\n",
    "- This was my first proper ML project where I achieved a high accuracy compared to my peers\n",
    "- I spent a high amount of time on the project and it really started my passion for ML#\n",
    "- I learnt many skills such as handling different types of data, data processing, trying and improving different models, tf-idf, dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements:\n",
    "- I spent most of the time trying to increasing my training score as high as possible which is bad as this clearly leads to overfitting\n",
    "- My inital data exploration and subsquent visualisations were poor\n",
    "- I used a bazaar versioning system rather than Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- I didnt structure my work very well and the explainations were more a stream of thoughts. \n",

    "## Frame the problem\n",
    "The problem is that we want to be able to take a tweet about a live news story and give a classification as to whether the contents of the message is real or fake. Such a system would be used by a news company to increase their confidence that any tweets they post in their articles are geniune. \n",
    "\n",
    "A current system would require a journalist to go through each individual tweet and make a decision themselves. With this system a list of refined real tweets could be presented to the journalist.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a supervised offline classification problem where the perfromance is measured by F1 score - the higher the score the more we can trust that a tweet classified as real is a genuine source that can be included in a report\n",
